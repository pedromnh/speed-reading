# Skim

**Skim** is a SwiftUI-based iPhone app designed for efficient reading on the go. It allows saving articles via the Share Sheet, which can be read on the app itself, displaying one word at a time at a speed chosen by the user in the settings page.

## Features

- **Save Articles Effortlessly**  
  Use the **Share Sheet** to add articles' contents from the browser directly to Skim.

- **Speed Reading Mode**  
  Tap on an article on the list in order to begin speed reading. Skim displays a single word at a time at the defined speed in order to cut down on distraction and make sure one reads through the article at a certain speed.

- **Customizable Reading Speed**  
  Adjust the reading speed via the **Settings Button**, accessible from the main screen on the top right.

- **Dark and Light Mode**  
  Change between Dark and Light modes based on the system's settings.

## How It Works  

1. **Saving Articles**  
   - While browsing through an article, use the Share Sheet and select Skim to save an article.  
   - The page is processed in order to extract its content, excluding any parts of the HTML unrelated to the article's content.

2. **Reading an Article**  
   - Tap on any article in the list to start speed reading.  
   - Words appear one at a time, centered for easy focus.  

3. **Setting Your Speed**  
   - Tap the **Settings Button** in the corner of the main screen.  
   - Use the slider to choose your preferred **Words Per Minute (WPM)**.

## Benefits  

- **Read More in Less Time**  
  Skim helps you skim through the articles quickly, in order to allow you to stay up to date on the news without taking up too much time.
